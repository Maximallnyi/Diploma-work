This repository contains the code for launching models for a thesis on the topic: "Classification of time series". 

In the main file.py contains the launch of each model on different datasets, with the output of the results to the command line.

The code was run using the Kaggle platform, since my device did not allow me to store and run such a volume of information, so the data is taken from Kaggle datasets.
